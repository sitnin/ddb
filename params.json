{"name":"Ddb","body":"#Dumb .deb builder\r\n\r\nCurrent version: 0.2.0\r\n\r\nProject website: http://sitnin.github.com/ddb/\r\n\r\nThis is a python script which reads package description from a single JSON-file and creates binary package.\r\n\r\nRationale is very simple: this script doesn't compile or build anything. It just packs bunch of files (like your python or node.js website project) into a package.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\n    $ echo \"deb http://deb.sitnin.com/ ddb/\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list\r\n    $ apt-get update\r\n    $ apt-get install ddb\r\n\r\n## Building of the ddb package\r\n\r\nI build ddb .deb package with ddb itself since the very first package. It's simple:\r\n\r\n    $ ddb -r deb/deb.json -s ./ -o ./out -t ./tmp -u3 -f\r\n\r\nAnd this is how is the output looks like:\r\n\r\n    Dumb .deb builder version 0.1.0 (c) Gregory Sitnin, 2012.\r\n\r\n    Source: /home/builder/ddb\r\n    Output: /home/builder/ddb/out\r\n    Temp: /home/builder/ddb/tmp\r\n    Rules file /home/builder/ddb/deb/deb.json\r\n\r\n    Copying files...\r\n    Generating DEBIAN directory contents...\r\n    Building package...\r\n    dpkg-deb: building package `ddb' in `ddb_0.1.0-0ubuntu3_all.deb'.\r\n    Building package...\r\n    Deleting temporary directory...\r\n\r\n    Package built: /home/builder/ddb/out/ddb_0.1.0-0ubuntu3_all.deb\r\n","tagline":"Dumb .deb builder","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
