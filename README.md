#Dumb .deb builder

Current version: 0.1.0
Project website: http://sitnin.github.com/ddb

This is a python script which reads package description from a single JSON-file and creates binary package.

Rationale is very simple: this script doesn't compile or build anything. It just packs bunch of files (like your python or node.js website project) into a package.
